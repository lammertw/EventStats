## Usage

Check the eventId of your event and get your Parse Application Id and REST API Key. In the example below we use abcd1234.

Then retrieve the Talks and UserFavoriteTalks of the event using the following requests (make sure to use the eventId of your event and make sure the output directory exists):

Get all talks of the event:

    curl -X GET \
      -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: qrst567" \
      -H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: uvw890" \
      -G \
      --data-urlencode 'where={"event":{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Event","objectId":"abcd1234"}}' \
      https://api.parse.com/1/classes/Talk > out/Talks.json

Get all favorites of the event:

    curl -X GET \
      -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: qrst567" \
      -H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: uvw890" \
      -G \
      --data-urlencode 'where={"event":{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Event","objectId":"abcd1234"}}' \
      https://api.parse.com/1/classes/UserFavoriteTalks > out/UserFavoriteTalks.json

Next, run the index.js script with the two json files as input.

    node index.js out/Talks.json out/UserFavoriteTalks.json
